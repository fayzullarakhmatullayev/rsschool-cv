### Code example:

**Human Readable Time from CODEWARS**
_**Description:**_
Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

- HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
- MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
- SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
- The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

_**My solution:**_

```
function humanReadable(seconds) {
  const hours = seconds / 3600, minutes = seconds / 60 % 60, newSeconds = seconds %  60 ;
  return formatDate(hours) +':' + formatDate(minutes)+':'+formatDate(newSeconds)
}

function formatDate(n){
  const number = Number.parseInt(n)
  return number > 9? number : '0'+number;
}
```
